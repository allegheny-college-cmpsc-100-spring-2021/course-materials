### Canonical course description

> An introduction to the principles of computer science with an emphasis on creative expression through the medium of a programming language. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students learn the computational structures needed to solve problems and produce artifacts such as interactive games and computer-mediated art and music.  Students also learn how to organize and document a program's source code so that it effectively communicates with the intended users and maintainers. Additionally, the introduction includes an overview of the discipline of computer science and computational thinking.  During a weekly laboratory session students use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written reports and oral presentations.

* Prerequisite knowledge: Elementary algebra
* Distribution requirements: `ME`,`SP`

### Less canonical, but still official, course description

Some interpretations of the subject treat "computer science" as a kind of sacrosanct technical knowledge. And that is somewhat true: to some, it serves as a characterization of how skills learned as part of how the discipline is exercised in service of implementing or achieving a technical goal. There are certainly technical constructs that programmers have to obey, and rules that, while somewhat pliable, are relatively inflexible. Undoubtedly, you'll encounter frustration in this course with conventions arising from technical agreements that may seem arbitrary.

But, as we'll see in this course, "computer science" can exist outside of theorems, laws, or "rules" and, instead, serve as just another tool by which to express ideas, some of which happen to be technical in service or nature. No different than a pencil, oil paints, brushes, or a piano, computer code can be used as a tool to express artistic or even impractical ideas via _computational thinking_, a set of thought processes which we are often unaware that we exercise on a daily basis.

Instead of only relating technical details (of which there are many), this course explores ways to ideate and realize concepts on the path to achieving basic fluency in a new language, enabling abstract ideas to become digital reality.

### Required instructional materials

#### Textbook(s)

There are no textbooks for this course. Any texts or articles used will be available online or distributed by the instructor.

However, two (free) texts which students might find helpful:

* [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/)
* [A Byte of Python](https://python.swaroopch.com/)

#### Platforms

This course relies on the [GitHub](https://www.github.com), [Slack](https://cmpsc-100-sp-2021.slack.com) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.cs.allegheny.edu/) platforms. Your work will be assigned and evaluated using these platforms and official course communication will take place through them. You are expected to sign up for accounts and remain active on these platforms throughout the semester.

#### Media

Before each week begins, I will assign a group of short, topic-focused videos to review. These videos may contain activities that you can do in parallel with or after watching material. Video content is meant to support, but not substitute for, topics discussed and exercised that week. I will provide links to participate in or to access activities or supplmentary material in a Slack post along with video links.

### Learning objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

* Develop and realize moderately complex ideas in a digital medium
* Understand the basic language-independent principles of "object-oriented programming" (OOP)
* Express basic fluency in the Python programming language
* Exercise an intermediate grasp of industry-standard tools used to build software (e.g GitHub, Jupyter notebooks)
* Learn to adapt to the important, but often accidental, aspects of writing code
* Demonstrate the ability to communicate, plan, and collaborate as an integral part of the creative process

#### Class participation

Participation serves as one of the main vehicles for success in a class like this. The term "participation" means _actively engaging with and sincerely attempting completion of class activities_, of which there may be multiple in a given week. Due dates for class activties will be given at the time of assignment along with activity guidelines. In some cases (especially in the opening weeks of the course), completing activities is crucial to being able to progress in the class. 

I also write this with full awareness that the hybrid nature of this course complicates what one might assume the word "presence" to mean. Here, you should understand that my meaning _does not_ contemplate "attendance." There are members of our community working both remotely _and_ in timezones with time differences too great to watch streams live. See the [recorded content](#recorded-content) note below.

In addition, I expect that activities and/or worksheets given during these sessions will be completed by the deadlines indicated on materials distributed during the session. These due dates/times will be flexible enough to allow students to complete work at a reasonable pace (i.e. items will never be due at the literal end of class). 

These activities are the main mechanic I use to assign participation grades.

###### Recorded content

I will be recording _all_ class content. This means that:

* You have the right to turn off your camera and/or audio input
* You have the right to choose not to be present
* You have the right to choose to watch recorded materials later

I ask that, if you are unable to watch or attend live sessions, you reach out to me so that we can advantage you with the resources you need for this course (including scheduling a regular office-hour check in).

##### Use of class session platforms

This course will use:

* YouTube
* Google Meet

These platforms are for our use only. To use them, you'll need to be logged in using your Allegheny College Google Accounts. Moreover, by remaining enrolled in this class, you agree _not_ to share these resources with anyone _outside of_ our course.

This provision, while it seems minor, is extremely important in making sure that our course community stays a healthy one.

#### Lab assignments

These assignments will contain challenges which assume cumulative knowledge of course concepts. Various assignments will feature individual or group work, and are graded on completion and completeness. The amount of points for each assignment is progressive, and reflects the difficulty inherent in the tasks required.

#### Worksheets

These assignments are intended to allow students to practice and extend concepts without fear of failure. Worksheets are short assignments graded on the basis of honest attempts made at completion. The amount of points for each assignment is progressive, and reflects the difficulty inherent in the tasks required.

#### Assessments

Any assessment in this course is open book, open note, and "open code." Of course, this means that questions I ask may not _directly_ test your memory and, instead, expect application of a concept.

##### Quizzes

Quizzes will be given as part of a given week's required [media](#media). These quizzes will not require you to code, though you may find that using our class coding platform in tandem with the quiz helps you answer questions. The purpose of these quizzes is both for you to self-assess your progress and for me to check in on how the class is progressing as a whole. If a quiz indicates that the class might benefit from a more focused live session on a topic, I will offer one.

These quizzes are due by `8:00 AM` on Thursdays of a given week. Each quiz will be worth `10` points, and may reflect cumulative content. At the end of the semester, I will "drop" the lowest `2` scores.

##### Course project

This project offers students the opportunity to develop a realized version of an reasonably complex student-created project. Completion of this project will require use of the knowledge accumulated throughout the semester. Details for this project will be given out at the approximate mid-point of the semester. This task will require planning, careful evaluation, and implementation of a wide variety of concepts, and will allow students to choose and implement a project of their chosen discipline/application and approaches/methods. This project will be subject to approval by the instructor through a process including a formal proposal, interim updates, and technical reports.

### Course preparation

I expect students to arrive to class prepared. Here, "prepared" means having completed reading assignments, compiled questions, and being ready to engage thoughtfully with course material. In order to assist students' preparedness efforts, I will provide a schedule with assignments and will accompany all videos with a copy of the slides presented.

#### Preparation for office hours

To make the most of our time during office hours, please use the [Student Support Ticket system](https://chomp.link/support-tickets) to file a "ticket" as early as possible in order for us to discuss issues during our office hour time.

##### Student Support Ticket system

The [Student Support Ticket system](https://chomp.link/support-tickets) is a form designed to collect as much basic data about a course issue you're experiencing. This form will undergo revision throughout the semester, but its goal is always the same: to be able to effectively track, understand, and provide support for issues as quickly as possible.

Failure to fill out tickets may mean that it's harder to get you the support you need.

### Allegheny College Statement of Community

Allegheny College also expects students and faculty to act according to its Statement of Community:

> Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms. This statement does not replace existing personnel policies and codes of conduct.

Keep both of these standards in mind as you exercise your academic inquiry in this course. These serve as our fundamental "first principles" in pursuit of our shared academic goals.

### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students.  Such dialogue is encouraged.  However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else’s work.  It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code.  Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the _Compass_.

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

### Classroom ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. I encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Seeking assistance

#### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from the course instructor and teaching assistants. To meet with me, consult my available office hours (above) and make an appointment.

Historically, students who are successful in my courses visit and discuss course concepts with the instructor and Technical Leaders early and often. See [above for my office hours](#office-hours) or go to [this schedule for Technical Leaders' office hours](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/teaching/technicalleaders/).

#### Assistance outside of the course

If you find yourself in difficult circumstances which affect your ability to participate in or complete course work, let me know immediately. Full stop.

Do not wait until the end of the semester. 

Part of my role as a course instructor is to make sure that students receive the assistance they need. Do not hesitate to let me know if there is anything I can do with respect to your ability to handle your work. This is especially true of our current circumstances. Again, let me remind you -- __**it is part of my job**__ to help you access Allegheny College resources that will enable your safety and success.

In many situations, the following list of resources may help:

* [The Maytum Learning Commons](https://sites.allegheny.edu/learningcommons/)
* [Allegheny College Counseling Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/learningcommons/)
* [The Winslow Health Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/healthcenter/)
